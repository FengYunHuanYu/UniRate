UniRate - A better drop-in solution for rating mobile apps
=======

**UniRate** is a Unity package to help you promote you mobile games by prompting users to rate the app after using it for a few days or times. Integrating UniRate to your project is deadly simple as a drag & drop. It will count the using of the times and days automatically and if the conditions you set are met, a native prompt will pop up and user can decide whether rate it or not. This approach is one of the best ways to get positive app reviews by targeting only regular users (who presumably like the game or they wouldn't keep playing it).

You can purchase `UniRate` from [this link of Unity Asset Store](http://) and use it in all your projects with the purchase Unity ID.

All code is well documented and you can find online manual and forum support in links below. Hope you use it happily!
